# Virtual-Radar-Server-Add-Air-Traffic-Control-Audio
A bit of a greasy script to add ATC audio to virtual radar server via the custom content plugin.
A few prerequisites is that this is only tested on my local insatall or Virtual Radar Preview Release 3, it may work with others also. You must have the custom content plugin insalled and enabled.
