# Virtual-Radar-Server-Add-Air-Traffic-Control-Audio
A bit of a greasy script to add ATC audio to virtual radar server via the custom content plugin.
A few prerequisites is that this is only tested on my local install or Virtual Radar Preview Release 3, it may work with others also. You must have the custom content plugin insalled and enabled. This script uses audio from https://www.liveatc.net/
.Being from the UK ive got the audio link from EIDW Gnd/Twr/App/Centre - Dublin, Ireland as an example.
